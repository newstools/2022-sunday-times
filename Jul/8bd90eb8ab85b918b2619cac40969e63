Despite the challenges being faced by the manufacturing sector, Absa’s Purchasing Managers’ Index reached a record month-on-month level in March (before the floods), indicating that manufacturing sentiment was buoyant.  That same month, new car sales reached their highest level since the onset of the pandemic, and the outlook seems tentatively positive for one of the country’s largest manufacturing sectors.
